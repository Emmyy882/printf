#This Repo is an ALX Software Engineering Project to create a _printf function that works similar ways to the printf function.



Tasks
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
mandatory
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%
You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers




1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
mandatory
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

d
i
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers





2. With a face like mine, I do better in print
#advanced
Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    _printf("%b\n", 98);
    return (0);
}
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ ./a.out
1100010
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$






3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
#advanced
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

u
o
x
X
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
